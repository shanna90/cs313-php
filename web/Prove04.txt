After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
The loan table uses the book id as a foriegn key, and makes sure it is unique, so only one person can borrow a single book 
at one time. 

2. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.
There are some feilds in the table that only apply to certain types of books, so I wonder if I should have separate 
tables for each type of book. Now, the type is an integer, with 1 being for adult books, and 2 being for children's books.
I wonder if that could be done less ambiguously.

3. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The fact I ever got bitnami to work. Though I'm still unsure about the technology. I'm used to Oracle, not PostgreSQL

4. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
Good databases have clear relationships, and logical labeling. 

5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I believe that the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints were not in the reading, and therefore above the requirements.
