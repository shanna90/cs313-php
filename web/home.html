			<p> As a software engineer, I love creating applications that are
			enjoyable to use and easy to maintain. I believe that the move towards a more digital
			and connected world is more than a trend; it is the power to increase efficiency, 
			enhance communication, and access history's greatest repository of knowledge.
			I am honored to be able to contribute to this progress as a developer. Let me 
			help you to see how technology can revolutionize your organization. I 
			specialize in user-centric mobile applications and websites so that together
			we can change how the world sees <strong>you</strong>. </p>

			<p> I have always been interested in engineering because of the unique blend of creativity 
			and technical skill. I settled on Software Engineering because it is so flexible that I have
			the opportunity to work in just about every field, which keeps me on my toes and allows me to
			learn about, well, everything! When I am not programming, I love to read,
			go hiking, create music, and spend time with my family. I also love to teach and volunteer at 
			a local educational co-op teaching science and technology to children.
